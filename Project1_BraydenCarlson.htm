      <p>Use the following prompts to evaluate the selected web site:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>
        <li>How does this site organize the flow of information?</li>
        <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
        <li>Do the graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li>
        <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li>
        <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background was used, did it help or hurt?</li>
        <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was it well done?</li>
        <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look &amp; feel repeated on all pages?</li>

      <h2 id="tj-heading">Trader Joe’s – <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.traderjoes.com/</a></h2>
      <p class="meta">Reviewed on September 10, 2025 using a laptop browser (desktop viewport) and a phone (mobile viewport).</p>

      <ol class="answer-list">
        <li><strong>Q1 – First impression:</strong> Friendly, upbeat, and approachable. The homepage highlights seasonal items with large, high-quality images and playful illustrations that match the brand’s personality. The overall feel is welcoming and informal rather than corporate.</li>

        <li><strong>Q2 – Information flow:</strong> Primary navigation appears at the top with clear categories (e.g., Products, Recipes, Stores, Podcasts/News). Below that, the homepage uses hero sections and card-style tiles to route you to featured content. Calls-to-action are short and obvious.</li>

        <li><strong>Q3 – Site structure sense:</strong> The structure is logical: top-level categories lead to browsable listings with filters; detail pages use consistent headings, images, and ingredient or description blocks. Breadcrumbs and “Back to results” links reduce getting lost.</li>

        <li><strong>Q4 – Graphics/layout/multimedia:</strong> Art direction is consistent with Trader Joe’s in-store vibe (hand-drawn accents and bright product shots). Graphics enhance scannability and do not overwhelm text. Multimedia is lightweight and complements the content.</li>

        <li><strong>Q5 – Load time:</strong> Pages are image-heavy but optimized; on a typical broadband connection they load quickly and remain responsive after initial paint. Caching appears effective when navigating between product and recipe pages.</li>

        <li><strong>Q6 – Readability &amp; backgrounds:</strong> Text contrasts well against light backgrounds, with generous font sizing and spacing. Body text is easy to read; headings are bold without being overpowering. Backgrounds are mostly white or light neutral tones that keep focus on content.</li>

        <li><strong>Q7 – Navigation quality:</strong> The sticky top navigation and prominent search box make it easy to jump between tasks (finding a product, a recipe, or a nearby store). Footer navigation mirrors key links for redundancy. Overall, navigation is clear and consistent.</li>

        <li><strong>Q8 – Consistent look &amp; feel:</strong> The brand’s red accents, hand-lettered style headings, and illustration style repeat across pages. Buttons, cards, and spacing follow a consistent visual system which helps recognition and speeds up browsing.</li>

        <li><strong>Q9 – Responsive design:</strong> On smaller screens, the navigation collapses into a mobile menu. Cards stack vertically, images resize, and interactive elements remain finger-friendly with adequate touch targets. Content remains complete without awkward horizontal scrolling.</li>

        <li><strong>Q10 – Notable strengths:</strong> The integrated recipe ecosystem (linking products to recipes), the personable editorial tone (e.g., “Fearless Flyer”-style content), and the store locator together create a shopping-plus-inspiration experience that goes beyond a basic grocery catalog.</li>
